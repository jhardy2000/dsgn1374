		<div class= q> <h2> What do you find attracts you to a website? What makes it eye-catching and/or pretty? </h2> </div>
		<div class= a> <p>A nicely organized homepage, banner, and appealing palette catches my eye. It is important for a website to represent the brand and be legible.</p> </div>
		<div class= q> <h2> Do you prefer simplicity or gaudiness provided the website serves its purpose and functions properly? Are you willing to use a website that doesn’t serve its purpose well, yet boasts good content?</h2> </div>
		<div class= a> <p>I prefer simplicity in a website’s design because at the end of the day, the design is secondary — I’ve come to see the information on the website. I wouldn’t use a shabby website that has good content because there are other websites to use instead, and I din’t want to have to deal with accessibility issues. To me, a website’s functionality is the most important factor.</p> </div>
		<div class= q> <h2>Do you find that the quality of a website makes you more inclined to look at the content? Does it feel more trustworthy?</h2> </div>
		<div class= a> <p> Yes I do. The quality of a website makes it feel more professional. If the content is displayed nicely, then I feel like I can trust the content because it was created by someone who knows what they’re doing.</p> </div>
		<div class= q> <h2> Have you ever considered what goes into creating a website? Do you believe that consumer awareness is important?</h2> </div>
		<div class= a> <p>I’ve considered how a website is made, but the whole deal is too intimidating to approach. I think it’s important for customers to know general design tricks instead of the intricacies. For example, how Google controls advertisements and algorithms. Things like that mean more to me than the coding of a website.</p> </div>
